# intro-to-linux-on-palmetto2

Linux is an operating system (OS) that allows software applications to run on computer hardware that consists of a motherboard, random access memory (RAM), central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), disk storage, network interface cards (NICs), input devices (e.g. keyboard and mouse), and output devices (e.g. screens and printers). Click here for a great overview of [how a computer works](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/basics_of_computers/index.htm) and [how to build your own computer](https://www.neweggbusiness.com/smartbuyer/buying-guides/building-pc-ultimate-beginners-guide-part-1/).

The most popular OS’s include macOS, Windows, Linux, and Android. All four have graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that allow users to open windows and click on graphical icons to interact with the computer. Another way to interact with a computer is with the command line interface (CLI) where commands are typed as text. The command line is a powerful environment to process a lot of data using text commands. Once you get the hang of it, you may find that GUIs sometimes get in the way when you are doing Digital Biology!

In this lab, you will remotely access the Palmetto2 computer cluster.  You will access Palmetto2 using the Open Ondemand software tool.

# Task A: Accessing the cluster.

* Open a web browser (Chrome, Safari, Edge, etc.) and go the the Clemson Ondemand site:  [Palmetto2](https://ondemand.rcd.clemson.edu)
* Start an interactive apps>>Jupyter Notebook session.  Change these resource allocations: CPU=4, memory=64GB, Number of Hours=12. This will create a 12 hour interactive session and allow you to interface with the cluster. When you launch new sessions, you can change the resource allocation if necessary.
* Once launched, open a terminal to interact with the cluster in the bash environment using a CLI.

# Task B: Trying out basic linux commands.
Let’s download and uncompress the sea squirt (Ciona intestinalis) genome file. On the command line type:

```
wget http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/ci3/bigZips/ci3.fa.gz
```

Note: This command might be displayed on multiple lines but should be entered as one line.

See the name of the file with this command:

```
ls
```
Uncompress the file with this command:

```
gunzip ci3.fa.gz
```

See the new name of the file with this command:

```
ls
```

Type some Linux commands in the CLI.
NOTE: Linux is case sensitive so uppercase and lowercase letters are different.

# Display Linux system information:```

```
uname
uname -a
```

NOTE: Linux commands often have arguments (e.g. -a) that allow you to modify the program behavior.

# List all files in a long listing (detailed) format:

```
ls
ls -a
ls -l
ls -al
man ls
```
NOTE: If you want to know more information about a command, type: man <command_name>

# Display the present working directory:
```
pwd
```
Note: A directory is just like a folder on your laptop.  It is a place to store files.

# Create a directory:
```
mkdir <diectory_name>
```

#Example: 
```
mkdir genomes
```
NOTE: The angled brackets represent text that the user types. In this case any directory name can be entered after the mkdir command. For example, you could make a ‘genomes’ directory.

# Copy files:
```
cp <fileA> <fileB>
#Example:
cp ci3.fa seasquirt.fa
```

# Rename or move files from one name or place to another. If fileB is an existing directory, move fileA into directory fileB:
```
mv <fileA> <fileB>
#Example: 
mv ci3.fa ciona_genome.fa
```

# Change directories:
```
cd <directory_name>
#Example: 
cd genomes
```

# View the contents of file:
```
cat <file_name>
# Browse through a text file:
less <file_name>

# Display the first 10 lines of file:
head <file_name>

# Display the last 10 lines of file:
tail <file_name>
```

```
# Remove (delete) file:
rm <file_name>
```
NOTE: Removing files in Linux can be dangerous. You will not be able to undo a delete! Be careful but don’t be afraid .

# Show free and used space on mounted filesystems:
```
df -h
```

# Display free and used RAM memory:
```
free -h
#( -h for human readable, -m for MB, -g for GB.)
```

# Display and manage the top running processes:
```
top
#Press q to quit top
```
NOTE: If you want to exit a program on the command line, press (CTRL + C) at the same time.

# Exit the terminal:

```
exit
```

Note:  When doing work on the cluster, always start by creating a working directory in the 'scratch space' and not your home directory.   Scractch space is located in 

'''
/scratch/USRNAME/

#Example
cd /scratch/jdoe
mkdir seqsquirt_project_2025-12-13
'''
